# App menu — the Basecamp-style jump menu

## Summary
The admin's global navigation: a centered "Inkwell ⌄" trigger in the top bar
opens a command-palette sheet with a quick-nav card grid, a type-to-filter jump
search, secondary destinations, and recent records. Distinct from the per-record
**context menu** (`.menu--context`, "what do I do here"); this is "where do I go."

## Details
Three load-bearing primitives (over [[app-shell]] / [0004](../decisions/0004-top-bar-app-shell.md)):

1. **Disclosure-as-dialog** — the trigger is a `popovertarget` button; the sheet
   is a native Popover (`role="dialog"`), which gives Esc + click-outside dismiss,
   top-layer rendering, and a `::backdrop` scrim (the `--scrim` token) for free.
   Positioned `1em` from the top.
2. **Server-rendered content** — `layouts/_app_menu.html.erb` + `AppMenuHelper`:
   a card grid (Posts/Books/Series), a "Go to" list (Forum/Chatroom/Settings),
   and Recent records (last-touched, each with a type icon + badge). Home is a
   house icon in the header-left.
3. **Type-to-filter** — the `app-menu` Stimulus controller filters the rendered
   rows live, hides empty groups, and supports ↑/↓/Enter; the search autofocuses
   on open.

Refs: `../../app/views/layouts/_app_menu.html.erb`,
`../../app/javascript/controllers/app_menu_controller.js`,
`../../app/helpers/app_menu_helper.rb`,
`../../app/assets/stylesheets/app-menu.css`.

## Gotchas / open questions
- Not yet (the Basecamp "polish" tier): a true focus-trap (native popover lets
  Tab escape), a lazy/prefetched `turbo-permanent` frame (currently rendered
  inline each page), remote search beyond loaded rows, a global open hotkey,
  favorites/stars, per-item hotkeys.
